# Meta-Capstone-Projects
Capstone Projects from Meta Marketing Professional Certification

This is a presentation, regrading insights I found in sample Business Problem

Scenario - 
Inu + Neko is a company,they are a pet supply and services company that just started an e-commerce business. You have been asked to help them analyze their data to help 
them make better decisions in the future. Inu + Neko had a lot of success with a marketing campaign and is seeing a lot of growth. The company wants to know how these 
new incoming customers differ from their past customers. Are there different items they should stock more of? Are there other things they should consider?

Process For this capstone project I followed the OSEMN process, with data provided.

First Step - I wrote hypothetically approach for this project and how I gathered the necessary data. 
Second Step - I cleaned up and scrubbed data that provided for me inside a Jupyter notebook. 
Third Step - I explored the cleaned data in a second Jupyter notebook environment. 
Fourth Step - I created a visualization of some of my findings in Tableau. 
Fifth Step - I have created a presentation regrading my findings, and OSEMN process I gone through to fing my insights.

This is a big project, but it really gave me an understanding of some of the work a marketing analyst does day in and day out.
