Week 1: Getting to Know the Data
This week is all about descriptive statistics. I learned about measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion, frequency tables, scatter plots, and 
correlation coefficients. These all can be important tools for understanding your marketing data. For this Capstone Week 1 assignment, I used these tools 
to better understand the data in the Capstone Dataset spreadsheet.

The spreadsheet consist of - 
a Facebook Ad campaign and an AdWords Ad campaign. The data is collected for every day of the year 2019, so we have 365 lines of campaign data to analyze! 
Ultimately, we want to determine whether one of these ad campaigns is more effective, in terms of conversions, compared to the other. But before we address 
that question, we should get a better understanding of the conversion data for each of the campaigns.

To better understand how effective our campaigns are at producing conversions, we’re going to begin by analyzing the relationship between a campaign’s number 
of clicks and the corresponding number of conversions. 
Let’s do this by calculating 
(1.) the measures of central tendency, 
(2.) some measures of dispersion, and 
(3.) the frequency and correlation data for a campaign’s clicks and conversions.

We’ve learned how to do all of these things with our spreadsheet software. Below, we show you the results we get for the Facebook Ad data. We started by creating 
a new sheet in our Capstone Dataset spreadsheet and copy-and-pasting the “Date,” “Facebook Ad Clicks,” and “Facebook Ad Conversions” data into the first three 
columns of our new sheet. This makes it easier to work with that specific data for the calculations that follow! 

Note: for your Capstone Week 1 assignment, we are doing these calculations for “AdWords Ad Clicks” and “AdWords Ad Conversions.”

1. Calculate Measures of Central Tendency
For this first set of calculations, let’s determine the mean, the median, and the mode for both the number of “Clicks” and the number of “Conversions.” 
we can calculate the mean using the =AVERAGE formula. In our example below, we displayed the result for “Clicks” in cell E2, and for “Conversions” in cell E6.
we can calculate the median using the =MEDIAN formula. In our example below, we displayed the result for “Clicks” in cell E3, and for “Conversions” in cell E7.
we can calculate the mode using the =MODE formula. In our example below, we displayed the result for “Clicks” in cell E4, and for “Conversions” in cell E8.

In our example, we show you the results for the Facebook Ad Clicks and the Facebook Ad Conversions. For your Capstone Week 1 assignment calculate the 
mean, median, and mode for AdWords Ad Clicks and AdWords Ad Conversions. 

2. Calculate the Standard Deviations
Now that we have determined the “middle” values for our ad campaigns let’s get a sense of how much variance from the middle value we should expect from our data. 
We’ll do this by calculating the standard deviation for our “Clicks” data and our “Conversions” data. This tells us how “spread out” our data is. 
we can calculate a standard deviation using the =STDEV formula. 

3. Create a Frequency Table for Conversions; Analyze the Correlation between Clicks and Conversions
Finally, let’s get a clearer picture on how much correlation there really is between our ad clicks and the number of conversions we get through the ad. 
Do more clicks on the ad really lead to more sales? We’ll address this question by, first, creating a frequency table that tells us exactly how many days of the year we recorded specific numbers of conversions: less than 6 conversions, 6 - 10 conversions, 11 - 15 conversions, and greater than 15 conversions (see example below). Then, we’ll analyze how much these conversions correlate to the number of clicks by creating a scatter plot for Conversions v. Clicks, and by calculating the correlation coefficient for these two variables. Recall from our reading on “Frequency, Contingency, and Scatter Plots” how to perform these tasks in Excel or Google Sheets:

You can create a frequency table byusing the =COUNTIF and =COUNTIFS formulas to count the number of occurrences for each grouping of conversions (i.e., “<6” occurrences, “>5” but “<11” occurrences, “>10” but “<16” occurrences, and “>15” occurrences). In our example below, you can find our frequency table in the area highlighted with the red “3a.”

You can create a scatter plot by using the “insert chart” functions in your spreadsheet software. (Refer to your software documentation for more information.)  In our example below, you can find our scatter plot in the area highlighted with the red “3b.”

You can calculate a correlation coefficient using the =CORREL formula. In our example below, we displayed the result for “Clicks” in cell E10, and for “Conversions” in cell E17.

In our example, we show you these items for the Facebook Ad Clicks and the Facebook Ad Conversions. For your Capstone Week 1 assignment create a frequency table for the AdWords Ad Clicks data (with the groupings described above); then create a scatter plot and calculate the correlation coefficient for the AdWords Ad Clicks and AdWords Ad Conversions data. You will enter your AdWords Ad results into your Capstone Slide Deck slides for week 1.

Your Turn!
Here’s what we got when we completed all the above tasks for the Facebook Ad Clicks and Facebook Ad Conversions data from the Capstone Dataset spreadsheet. (Question: what does our correlation coefficient and scatter plot tell you about the relationship between clicks and conversions for the Facebook Ad?)


Now it’s your turn! Complete these tasks for the AdWords Ad Clicks and AdWords Ad Conversions data from the Capstone Dataset spreadsheet. Enter your results into your Capstone Slide Deck. What does your correlation coefficient and scatter plot tell you about the relationship between clicks and conversions for the AdWords Ad?
